<p>Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) refers to human intelligence simulation of machines which are programmed to think like humans and imitate their behavior.The term may also apply to any machine that exhibits<br>
 human mind-related traits such as learning and problem-solving.The perfect function of artificial<br>
   intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take action that has the best chance of attaining a particular goal.<br>
    <br>
	Artificial intelligence is based on the premise that human intelligence should be described in such a way that a computer can easily imitate it and perform tasks, from the simplest to the more complex.<br>
	Artificial intelligence targets include comprehension, reasoning, and perception.AI is developing constantly to<br>
	support a number of different industries. Machines are designed using a mathematics, computer science , linguistics, psychology and more focused cross-disciplinary approach.<br>
	Throughout the context of artificial intelligence, algorithms also play a very important role, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complicated<br>
	ones help frame powerful artificial intelligentsia.<br>
	<br>
	Currently, artificial intelligence is commonly referred to as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is programmed to perform a narrow function ( e.g. just facial recognition or just<br>
	internet searches or only driving a car). But many researchers' long-term aim is to build general AI (AGI or strong AI). Although narrow AI would outperform humans in whatever specific<br>
	task they are doing, such as playing chess or solving equations, AGI can outperform humans in almost every cognitive activity.</p>
