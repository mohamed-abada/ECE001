<h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>In today's culture, Artificial Intelligence has diverse applications. It becomes important for today's time because in multiple sectors, such as healthcare, entertainment, finance, education, etc.,<br>
 it can solve complex problems in an effective way. AI is making our daily life more comfortable and fast.</p>
<br>

 <P>There are many applications of artificial intelligence in our life such:</P>
 <ul>
  <li><h3>AI in Astronomy</h3></li>
  Artificial intelligence can be very useful in solving complex problems within the universe. AI technology can help us understand the world,<br>
  such as how it functions, how it originates, etc.
  <li><h3>AI in Healthcare</h3></li>
  Lots of organizations and medical care centers rely on AI when it comes to saving our lives and there are many examples of how AI in healthcare has<br>
  helped patients around the world.
  <li><h3>AI in Finance</h3></li>
  The projects reliy on computers and data scientists to determine potential business dynamics. Trading ultimately relies on the ability to reliably forecast the future.<br>
  <li><h3>AI in Robotics</h3></li>
  Artificial Intelligence plays a major role in Robotics. Generally, general robots are programmed so that they can perform some repetitive tasks, but with the help of AI,<br>
  we can create intelligent robots that can perform tasks without pre-programming with their own experiences.
  <li><h3>AI in education</h3></li>
  AI will automate testing and the teacher can have more teaching time. As a teaching assistant, AI chatbot can interact with the students.<br>
  AI could be working as a intimate, virtual tutor for students in the future, which is easily accessible at any time and location.
</ul>
<Artificial intelligence has a great number of applications in our life and other that we are woking on it for the future</p>
